# proxius
Proxius is a K8s controller which makes it easy-peasy to automatically inject proxy environment variables across deployed pods.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.20.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/proxius:tag
```

Examples:
```sh
make docker-build docker-push
make docker-build docker-push IMG=localhost:5000/proxius:latest
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified. 
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment. 
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

(optional, you can skip to the next section)

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/proxius:tag
```

Example:
```sh
make deploy IMG=172.17.0.1:5000/proxius:latest
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin 
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Publish

See `research/` repo for the publishing steps.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**Undeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```
